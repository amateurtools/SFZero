SFZero
=====

SFZero is/was a player of SFZ and SF2 files, as an AU plugin.

If you're looking to use the SFZ/SF2 code, you should instead look at the
"SFZPlayer" directory of [sfzq](https://github.com/stevefolta/sfzq) -- it
supports a little more of the SFZ format, and has been freed from the clutches
of Juce.
